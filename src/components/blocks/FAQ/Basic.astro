        <Accordion
          title="How does Kiasoftwares work, and how are we different from other agencies ?"
          text="We are a team of freelance developers, not an agency. Once you start a project with us, a dedicated developer is assigned to work with you throughout the project lifecycle. We also provide non-technical support, and 90% of the project cost goes directly to the developer."
        />
        <Accordion
          title="Will I have a dedicated developer for my project?"
          text="Yes! Each project is assigned a dedicated freelance developer who will work with you from development to deployment, ensuring consistency and quality."
        />
        <Accordion
          title="Do you provide support beyond development?"
          text="Absolutely! Along with your developer, our non-technical support team is available to assist with any coordination and communication needs. Additionally, post-development, we can either transfer full code ownership or manage the deployment and maintenance for you."
        />
        <Accordion
          title="How is the pricing of the project calculated"
          text="Our project pricing is based on development complexity and additional services like deployment and maintenance. We don't charge hourly; instead, we provide a fixed price for the entire project after understanding your requirements. The agreed price remains the same unless the client requests significant changes beyond the original scope."

          <Accordion
          title="How is the project duration or timeline calculated"
          text="Before finalizing the price, we provide you with a detailed timeline outlining each project phase. We strive to complete the project within the agreed timeframe, provided there are no major changes from the clientâ€™s side. If we fail to meet the deadline, we do not penalize our developers. Instead, as a gesture of goodwill, we offer additional features for your project at no extra cost."
        />
                  <Accordion
          title="How can I trust you?"
          text="Before starting the project, we sign a digital contract that clearly outlines all terms, including pricing and milestones. The pricing is milestone-based, as defined in the contract, which we finalize together. Additionally, you can review our previous projects to understand the quality and standards of our work."
        />
                          <Accordion
          title="What if you couldn't deliver the project?"
          text="So far, we have never failed to deliver a project. If, at any point, our freelance developer faces challenges, we will assign an additional support team to ensure timely completion. In the rare event that we are still unable to deliver, we will issue a full refund of the project amount"
        />
                                  <Accordion
          title="Can my projects remain confidential, and will you sign an NDA?"
          text="Absolutely! We prioritize your project's confidentiality. If you wish, we can sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure complete privacy and maintain secrecy throughout our collaboration"
